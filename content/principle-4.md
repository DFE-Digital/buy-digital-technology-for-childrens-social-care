title: "4. Design systems to be accessible and inclusive"
---

##Why is it important

Children’s social care digital systems and tools must be accessible, so that anyone can use them anywhere.

##What it means

All case management systems should be designed to meet the needs of a diverse range of users. This includes those with different physical, cultural or learning needs. 

Tools and systems must be user -centred and be:

* easy to understand
* easy to use
* informative
* meet accessibility standards for both online and offline elements
* avoid excluding any users they are intended to serve

Vendors and local authorities should:

* carry out research with potential users for the service, including people with access needs
* make sure people aren’t excluded from using the system because they lack digital skills or internet access (offline working) - appropriate digital support should be provided if necessary 
* provide evidence of gathering and evaluating user feedback and release of appropriate updates

##Guidance

Testing with assistive technologies
Ergonomics of human-system interaction — Part 210: Human-centred design for interactive systems ISO 9241-210:2019
Understanding accessibility requirements for public sector bodie
Accessibility and assisted digital guidance
DCB1605: Accessible Information

##What should compliance look like

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* the system works across different devices and is browser based
* the system supports offline working
* document storage is included within the system
* meets current accessibility standards 
* works with assistive technology
* children and families can access their records through portals

Use of terminology that is inclusive of:

* religion
* nationality
* disability
* sexuality
* gender

##Possible barriers to implementation 

Systems often don't support accessibility tools (for example, screen readers) and may not be designed to meet current accessibility standards .. However, there are external products available that can support this for both organisations and clients. Capturing pronouns and names for children is a recurring issue for all local authorities.

##Importance of reflecting the voice of the child

Case management systems need to support professionals making decisions about childrens social care by ensuring they allow for the capture of, and accurate reflection on, the experiences, thoughts and opinions of the child or young person. Children and young people should always be involved and have information fed back to them in a way that they can understand. It is important the child or young person is able to see their voice reflected in their record to help them make sense of their personal story.

Social workers need systems that enable them to understand:

* what the child's life is like
* what they do each day
* how they feel about their lives
* how they want things to change

Focusing on the child means they feel listened to, and plans are more successful when children and young people are involved. It also supports social workers to make prompt decisions about safeguarding risks when necessary.

Local authorities should procure systems where children and young people have been directly involved in the design. They should use selection criteria which include outcome and impact measures that have been created from the child’s or young person’s perspective. 

This should be supported by: 

* training staff in co-design to involve children and young people in the process
* evaluation and selection processes which are designed and funded to properly involve children and young people 

Suppliers should design systems where children and young people have been directly involved (rather than just consulted) in the design and selection process. Features should be specifically designed to capture and reflect the voice of the child.

Systems should allow:

* local authorities to see how much direct work with children is taking place and enable oversight of child centred activities including outcomes, ambitions and strengths 
* for details to be captured that reflect each individual child - for example ways to describe gender, beliefs and interests
* social workers to upload a range of media and file sizes
* for the development of features and functionality which allow children and young people to directly interact with the system 
* for the development of features that support interoperability between a range of tools social workers may want to employ to engage children and young people 

Social workers use a range of tools to communicate and engage with children and young people in ways which support their personal choices, age, context and abilities. 

Children and young people should be directly involved in measuring the effectiveness of the system, by using outcome and impact measures created as part of the selection and evaluation process.

##Available guidance

(needs adding)

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* the system's ability to clearly identify and report the views of the child - including from them directly and by their social worker (team)
* that the system supports the upload and storage of a range of materials in different formats to reflect the story of the child and family
* that the system supports and encourages collaboration with children and families
* how the system supports families and children to engage with the children's social care services through standard products they use in everyday life
* how forms and workflows prompt the user to input information in a way that is written directly to the child

##Challenges

This is about making sure there are options to build into local design if needed, but in some cases this need can often be met outside of the system. Better engagement tools are needed to feed into the structured recording of a case management system.

title: "Design systems that are simple to use"
---

##Keep it simple

It costs local authorities time and money to deal with mistakes that happen when systems do not work well. Making things more complicated than they need to be undermines trust in the system.

Build and procure tools that are clear and simple to use, so that children, families, and practitioners can get things right the first time.

Providers and local authorities should:

* ensure the system allows users to do what they need to do as simply as possible
* regularly test for usability with users of the system
* ensure all parts of the system are consistent for the user
* develop the system to work with a range of devices, in particular for mobile working for social workers

##Available guidance

[User interface design](https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/user-interface-design.html)
[Designing for different browsers and devices](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/designing-for-different-browsers-and-devices)

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:
 
* how user feedback has informed changes to the user interface (UI)
* how it is informed by practice
* how it meets the requirements for:
     * less clicks
     * no unnecessary workflows
     * easy creation of genograms and chronology
     * less recording
     * less duplication of effort
     * consistent terminology
     * mobile working
* how easy it is to use and understand (and any training support required) 
* a consistent approach to data input and workflow- for example, edit button always in the same place 
* how it can be used on different devices
* how it caters for all abilities 
* how it works with assistive technologies

##Challenges

Competing needs to meet requirements in relation to statutory data returns or court proceedings, for example, and the end-users' needs of the system in supporting good childrens social care practice.

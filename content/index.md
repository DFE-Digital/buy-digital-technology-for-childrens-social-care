title: Digital standards for children's social care
---

The Department for Education has worked with Local Authorities and case management system providers to identify opportunities to improve the quality of children’s social care and the lives of children and families. 

We have developed a set of design prinicples and wish to build on these by working with the sevtor to offer further support and guidance for Local authorities and system vendors. 

Use this guidance alongside existing technical standards, as indicated, to plan, procure and implement children's social care case management systems.

## Reasons for key principles

Case management systems need to:

* meets user needs, based on research with users
* be is easy to share across government (Open Source) 
* be is easy to maintain
* be scalable for future use
* be less dependent on single third-party suppliers
* provide value for money

The resources section gives links to existing guidance on digital, data and technology that we refer to throughout these principles. 

## Principles

1. [Design systems in a user-centred way to meet user needs](/principle-1)
2. [Design systems to work interoperably](/principle-2)
3. [Design systems that are simple to use](/principle-3)
4. [Design systems to be accessible and inclusive](/principle-4)
5. [Design systems that reflect the voice of the child](/principle-5)
6. [Design systems that include performance analytics for monitoring](principle-6)
7. [Design systems that secure personal data without inhibiting children’s social care practice](principle-7)

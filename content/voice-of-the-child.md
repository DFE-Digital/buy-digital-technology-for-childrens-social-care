title: Voice of the child
---

## Introduction

The ‘voice of the child’ is a phrase used to describe the real involvement of children and young people in decisions that impact on their lives. The term is often used in legal and care cases, where practitioners are responsible for making decisions about a child or young person. For example during healthcare, social care or court proceedings. 

This guidance is for those who work with children and young people, either in a children’s social care setting or in an agency that works alongside children’s social care. 
Adequate steps should be taken to establish the wishes and feelings of children and young people

Practitioners should:

* focus on good practice
* ensure that the necessary action takes place
* use all sources of information
* carry out assessments effectively
* implement effective multi-agency working
* value challenge, supervision and scrutiny

## Building trust

Whilst practitioners should always take the voice of the child into account when making decisions about their care, sometimes what a child or young person wants may not be in their best interests.  

For example, if a child wants to return home to their parents full-time, but that is not possible. Practitioners would need to support the child to understand the decision and to find any compromise (where this is possible), such as increased contact. 

It is important that practitioners liaise with children and young people in a way that helps them to realise that their views are taken into consideration. Children and young people need to understand why a decision has been made. Offering options and compromises, such as supporting appropriate communication and contact with family members, can help children and young people feel involved in decisions and help them to settle. It is very important that practitioners communicate with children and young people in a way that they understand, so that they can ask questions and give feedback that can be recorded. 

## A holistic view

Practitioners need to gather information from a number of sources to take a holistic view of the child or young person, their experiences and their feelings.

This should include:

* listening to the child or young person
* recording accurately their experiences and feelings
* writing reports that address the child or young person using language that they understand
* taking appropriate steps to ensure that a child or young person is able to communicate freely, for example; considering the location, method, who is present and timings of visits
* listening to others, whose close contact may provide insight into the experiences and feelings of the child or young person (for example; family members, neighbours and teachers)

##Conflicting voices

The different voices that contribute to the voice of the child may offer conflicting information and there may also be conflicting needs. For example, if the parent of the child is also in a vulnerable position. 

Practitioners need to ensure they listen to all voices and consider how decisions and actions will impact on the children, young people and families involved. 

##Best practice (children’s social care)

There are five main messages with regard to the voice of the child. 

Practice should ensure:

* the child is seen frequently enough by the professionals involved, and is asked about their views and feelings
* agencies listen to adults who speak on behalf of the child and who had important information to contribute
* parents and carers do not prevent professionals from seeing and listening to the child
* practitioners balance the needs of vulnerable parents with the child, considering the implications for the child
* agencies take time to interpret their findings to protect the child

## Seeing and hearing the child

Practitioners should:

* use direct observation of babies and young children by a range of people and make sense of these observations are considered in relation to risk factors
* see children and young people in places that meet their needs – for example, in places that are familiar to them
* see children and young people away from their carers
* ensure that the assessment of the needs of disabled children identifies and includes needs relating to protection

##Listening to adults who speak on behalf of the child

Practitioners should routinely involve fathers and other male figures in the family in assessing risk and in gathering all the information needed to make an assessment.

Local Safeguarding Children Boards should  consider how they can better engage the general public in safeguarding children.

## Being alert to parents and carers who prevent access to the child

Practitioners should:

* consider the implications of the risks to children where they have concerns for their own personal safety
* ensure that respect for family privacy is not at the expense of safeguarding children

Local Safeguarding Children Boards should consider how children who are home educated can receive the same safeguards as their peers. 

##Understand the needs of the child, alongside the needs of the parent or carer

Practitioners should:

* recognise the specific needs of children and young people who have a caring responsibility for their parents
* always consider the implications of any domestic abuse for unborn children
* be alert to how acute awareness of the needs of parents can mask children’s needs

##Interpreting what children say in order to protect them

Agencies should be able to see and interpret:

* signs of grooming by a sex offender
* the significance of domestic violence and parental aggression
the difference between discipline, chastisement and physical abuse
* the significance of poor school attendance
* delinquent misbehaviour when it resulted from the offender being the victim of abuse by an adult
* the impact on the child from fulfilling the role of carer for a parent
* the impact of the agencies’ low expectations about parenting because of local cultural norms

Practitioners should:

* ensure that actions take account of children and young people’s views
* recognise behaviour as a means of communication
* understand and respond to behavioural indicators of abuse
* sensitively balance children’s and young people’s views with safeguarding their welfare

## Supporting systems

Systems should allow for practitioners to accurately capture the voice of the child from a range of sources and in a range of formats. These systems should also allow for practitioners to:

* appropriately share information with other agencies
* take a holistic view of the child and their circumstances
* reflect and record their assessments ahead of making any recommendations
* communicate information more widely, where appropriate

We have developed these standards with children social care case management service providers. 

Use this guidance alongside existing technical standards, as indicated, to procure and implement children's social care case management systems.

## Key Principles

We need to make sure technology:

* meets user needs, based on research with users
* is easy to share across government (Open Source) 
* is easy to maintain
* is scalable for future use
* is less dependent on single third-party suppliers
* provides better value for money

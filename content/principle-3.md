title: "3. Design systems that are simple to use"
---

##Keep it simple

It costs local authorities time and money to deal with mistakes that happen when systems do not work well. Making things more complicated than they need to be undermines trust in the system.

##Focus on end-users

Build and procure tools that are clear and simple to use, so that children, families, and practitioners can get things right the first time.

Vendors and local authorities should:

* ensure the system allows users to do what they need to do as simply as possible
* regularly test for usability with users of the system
* ensure all parts of the system are consistent for the user
* develop the system to work with a range of devices, in particular mobile working for social workers

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:
 
* how user feedback has informed changes to the UI
* how it is informed by practice
* how it meets the requirements for:
     * less clicks
     * no unnecessary workflows
     * easy creation of genograms and chronology
     * less recording
     * less duplication of effort
     * consistent terminology
     * mobile working
* how easy it is to use and understand (requiring minimum training, within reason),) 
* a consistent approach to data input and workflow- for example, edit button always in the same place 
* how it can be used on different devices
* how it caters for all abilities 

##Challenges

If you design around the user you capture how to make it simple. However, local authorities feel that competing needs by big hitters such as the court and government returns are often not innovative or modern approaches to social work, which can cause complex processes and requirements. Local authorities also find that the tool often drives practice when it should be the other way around. Need to take guidance from industries that try to cater to all levels of understanding - like smartphones.The userâ€™s experience (UX) should be similar to that of using day-to-day applications especially for children and families.

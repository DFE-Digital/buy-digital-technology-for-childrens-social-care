title: Designing case management systems in children's social care
---

We have developed this guidance to help local authorities and suppliers identify opportunities to improve case management systems to better support children’s social care services. We will continue to work with the sector to develop further support and guidance for local authorities and system suppliers to design case management systems that support children's social care best practice. 

Use this guidance alongside existing technical standards (as indicated) to plan, procure, implement and improve children's social care case management systems.

Case management systems need to:

* meet user needs, based on research with users
* support the sharing of information across agencies e.g. health and police 
* be easy to maintain
* be scalable for future use
* allow for intergration with third-party suppliers
* provide value for money

## Design considerations

When we design content management systems, we need to consider each of these areas:

1. [Being user-centred and meeting user needs](/principle-1)
2. [Allowing for interoperability](/principle-2)
3. [Making it simple to use](/principle-3)
4. [Accessiblility and inclusivity](/principle-4)
5. [Reflecting the voice of the child](/principle-5)
6. [Monitoring and performance analytics](principle-6)
7. [Securing personal data without inhibiting children’s social care practice](principle-7)

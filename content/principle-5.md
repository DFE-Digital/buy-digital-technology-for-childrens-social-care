title: "Principle 5 Design systems that reflect the voice of the child"
---

###Why is it important

To ensure their 'voice' influences the decisions that professionals make, children and young people should have the opportunity to give their input and experiences. They should always be involved and have information fed back to them in a way that they can understand. It is important the child is able to see their voice reflected in their record to help them make sense of their personal story.

###What it means

The child must play an active role in contributing to what is being set up. Social workers need to understand:

* what the child's life is like
* what they do each day
* how they feel about their lives
* how they want things to change

Focusing on the child means they feel listened to, and plans are more successful when they are involved. Prompt decisions can also be made about safeguarding when necessary.

Issues identified through Ofsted reviews:

* children are not seen enough by the professionals involved, or asked about their views or feelings
* agencies do not listen to adults who speak on behalf of the child who may have important information to contribute
* parents and carers keep practitioners away from the child
* practitioners focus too much on the needs of the parents or adults, especially vulnerable adults, and overlook the implications for the child
* agencies do not interpret their findings well enough to protect the child

Local authorities should procure systems where children and young people have been directly involved in the design and selection of it use selection criteria which include outcome and impact measures that have been created from the child’s or young person’s perspective. 

This should be supported by: 

* training in co-design for staff and children and young people involved in the process
* evaluation and selection processes which are designed and funded to properly involve children and young people 

Vendors should design systems where children and young people have been directly involved (rather than just consulted) in the design and selection process design features that specifically strengthen the voice of each child.

Systems should allow:

* local authorities to see how much direct work with children is taking place designing around child centred activity, including outcomes, ambitions and strengths ensuring details can be captured to reflect each individual child - for example ways to describe gender, beliefs and interests ensuring the system allows social workers to upload a range of media and file sizes
* for the development of features and functionality which allow children and young people to directly interact with the system 
* for the development of features that allow interaction supported by tools which enable children and young people to create and enter in ways which support their personal choices, age and context

Children and young people should be directly involved in measuring the effectiveness of the system, by using outcome and impact measures created as part of the selection and evaluation process.

###Guidance

(needs adding)

###What should compliance look like

During procurement, the following must be demonstrated:

* the ability to clearly identify and report the views of the child - including from them directly and via their care professional 
* allows a range of materials in different formats to reflect the story of the child and family
* encourages collaboration with children and families
* how families and children have access via standard products they use in everyday life
* how forms and workflows have prompts to make the user input information in a way so that it is written directly ‘to the child

###Possible barriers to implementation 

This is about making sure there are options to build into local design if needed, but in some cases this need is met outside of the system. Local authorities do not always view this as a clear business need and as a result, functions and requirements are not clearly defined. Better engagement tools are needed to feed into the structured recording of a CMS.

title: Principle 6: Design systems that include performance analytics for monitoring
---

###Why is it important

Data must be used to inform decision-making at all levels (from frontline workers, to strategic planners) and across the safeguarding partnership.

###What it means

Analytics should be built-in and easy to read. Performance data and analytics should be made available where possible to improve policy development and transparency.

Collect data that meets statutory guidance and monitors performance and make it accessible to users.

Data can be used more effectively by improving technology, infrastructure, and processes.

Information should be made available for decision-making as close to real-time as possible (for example, statutory data is currently a year out of date so itâ€™s too late to inform policy accurately in a fast moving sector). There's an ambition to get more real-time data, but huge resource and time currently goes into compiling and error checking.

###Guidance

Read Make better use of data
Read point 10 of the GDS Service Standard

###What should compliance look like

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated:

* how the system provides appropriate controlled access to the data through reports and data warehouse
* how it can run reports directly from the system
* how it can connect to data warehouse and PowerBI if needed
* how it allows managers to run reports through a suite of self-service report building tools which can be used at any time
* that the reporting tool is not process intensive

###Possible barriers to implementation 

Elements that can help (data type flags in the coding and retention) are not always robust or flexible enough to meet expectations. This should be the norm, not something that we strive to. Similar organisations can interpret the same information in different ways. All data requires context or leads to misunderstandings.

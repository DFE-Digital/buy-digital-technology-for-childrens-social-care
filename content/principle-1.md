title: "Design systems in a user-centred way to meet user needs"

##Importance of user needs

Service design starts with identifying user needs. Understanding the context gives you the best chance of meeting these needs in a simple and cost effective way. If you do not know what the user’s needs are, you will not build the right thing. Do research, analyse data and talk to users. Test assumptions and hypotheses. Have empathy for users and remember what they want versus what they need may be differ.

##Focus on end-users

Children’s social care tools and services must be procured, designed, and implemented in response to the practical and emotional needs of the end-user. 

There needs to be consideration of:

* the experience of Children, families and social workers
* the skills and abilities of those using the system
* the needs of frontline staff, performance managers and strategic leaders
* the needs of wider stakeholders, including those of DfE and Ofsted

There must be a clear understanding of how innovation or technology will result in better provision and outcomes for children.

Local authorities and suppliers must regularly work with users to assess the design and performance of their case management systems (CMS), and ensure that these assessments inform future iterations.

You should learn as much as possible about the problems facing users by:

* doing user research to understand what users need, and where necessary, secondary research and analysis
* building prototypes to test hypotheses and functionality
* using analytics and other available data to better understand the problem

System suppliers must work with local authorities to set out the measures that will be used to assess the outputs, outcomes and benefits of the CMS, setting Kep Performance Indicators (KPIs). Performance data and reports must be available to monitor and improve the service, this information should be assessed against the KPIs and used to inform iterations and improvements.

In addition, system suppliers must show where and how cost savings can be made as a result of the use of their CMS in a children's social care setting.

For this purpose, system suppliers must demonstrate:

* children’s social care expertise has been involved in the design, testing and sign-off of the product (including from children and young people)
* CMS functionality is fit for purpose
* data is valid, up to date and there’s a maintenance plan in place
* system surveillance is undertaken, and feedback is risk assessed and acted upon

##Available guidance

Guidance is available on [learning about users and their needs from Government Digital Services](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs) including:

* understanding what users need
* demonstrating compliance with this standard
* using data to improve your service

The [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual) helps teams to create and run great public services.

##Good practice

During procurement, the following should be demonstrated: 

* how the design and implementation uses ongoing user groups
* what social work input there has been in the design of the product
* what service user input there has been in developing the system
* how the user needs have been weighed against strategic and statutory priorities
* how the system provides easy access to the information the user needs and provides a pathway that matches the local authority’s operational practice

##Challenges

Different local authorities have users with different needs, abilities, and ways of working which makes standardisation challenging. Procurement is not always user-centred, so user needs do not feed though. Understanding the needs of internal users and children and families to allow them to co-create records in an open and transparent manner can be a challenge.

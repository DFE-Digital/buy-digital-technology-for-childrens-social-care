title: Digital standards
---

The Department for Education has worked with Local Authorities and others to identify opportunities to improve the quality of children’s social care to improve the lives of children and families. 

We have developed a set of design prinicples and guidance on data standards with children social care providers and vendors of existing systems. 

Use this guidance alongside existing technical standards, as indicated, to procure and implement children's social care case management systems.

## Reason for key principles

We need to make sure technology:

* meets user needs, based on research with users
* is easy to share across government (Open Source) 
* is easy to maintain
* is scalable for future use
* is less dependent on single third-party suppliers
* provides better value for money

The resources section gives links to existing guidance on digital, data and technology that we refer to throughout these principles and guidance. 

## Principles

1. [Design children's social care case management systems in a user-centred way to meet user needs](/principle-1)
2. [Design systems to work interoperably](/principle-2)
3. [Design systems that are simple to use](/principle-3)
4. [Design systems to be accessible and inclusive](/principle-4)
5. [Design systems that reflect the voice of the child](/principle-5)
6. [Design systems that include performance analytics for monitoring](principle-6)
7. [Design systems that secure personal data without inhibiting children’s social care practice](principle-7)

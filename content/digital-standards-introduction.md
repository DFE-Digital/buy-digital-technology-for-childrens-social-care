title: Digital standards introduction

The Department for Education has been working with a number of Local Authorities to identify opportunities to improve the quality of childrenâ€™s social care to improve the lives of children and families. 

We have developed a set of design prinicples and guidance on data standards with children social care providers and vendors of existing systems. 

Use this guidance alongside existing technical standards, as indicated, to procure and implement children's social care case management systems.

## Reason for key principles

We need to make sure technology:

* meets user needs, based on research with users
* is easy to share across government (Open Source) 
* is easy to maintain
* is scalable for future use
* is less dependent on single third-party suppliers
* provides better value for money

The resources section gives links to existing guidance on digital, data and technology that we refer to throughout these principles and guidance.

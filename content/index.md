title: Designing case management systems for children's social care
---

Use this guidance alongside existing technical standards (as indicated) to plan, procure, implement and improve children's social care case management systems.

We've developed this guidance to help local authorities and suppliers identify opportunities to improve case management systems to better support children’s social care services. We'll continue to work with the sector to develop further support and guidance for local authorities and system suppliers to design case management systems that support children's social care best practice. 

Case management systems need to:

* meet the needs of people who use system, based on research with them
* support the sharing of information across agencies, for example health and police 
* be easy to maintain
* be scalable for future use
* allow for integration with third-party systems
* provide value for money

## Design considerations

When we design case management systems, we need to consider each of the following areas:

1. [Being user-centred and meeting user needs](/principle-1)
2. [Systems need to talk to each other](/principle-2)
3. [Making systems simple to use](/principle-3)
4. [Making systems accessible and inclusive](/principle-4)
5. [Reflecting the voice of the child](/principle-5)
6. [Monitoring and performance analytics](principle-6)
7. [Securing personal data without inhibiting children’s social care practice](principle-7)
